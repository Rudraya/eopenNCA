# Enhanced openNCA (eopenNCA)

**e**openNCA is an R package for computation of Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA). eopenNCA is a free and open-source software maintained and supported by Rudraya.

eopenNCA is an advance extension of openNCA R3.0 package. openNCA's original codebase was based upon the Splus based "eNCA Computation Engine", which was the production pharmacokinetic (PK) bioanalysis data management repository and analysis system developed internally by Pfizer.

## Unique features of eopenNCA
- Parameters that are automatically calculated but not available in Third-Party tools without making a custom equation. 
- Parameters that are automatically calculated but not available in Third-Party tools at all.
- Multiple Dosing intervals can be calculated at the same time. 
- Metabolic Ratio Secondary Parameters can be automatically calculated with PK parameters.
- AUC calculation methods include Lin-Log,  Lin-up, Log-down, Lin and Log.
- User definable target function for Kel Optimization. 
- Unit Consistency Checks.
- Built-in checking of select parameters based on user defined criteria  in Flagging for Kel, etc.
- Insert missing data AUC Interpolation/Extrapolation.
- Handling of Data Records and Profiles with Negative Times Post Dose.

## Qualification of eopenNCA for GxP use
A fully qualified release of eopenNCA for GXP production use (meeting all regulatory requirements with appropriate documentation) is also available. Please contact info@rudraya.com for details.
